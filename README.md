# X-ray-based-disease-detection
This repository is showing a program that uses an algorithm to detect COVID-19 X-rays. This program can be applicable to any disease that uses an x-ray for diagnosis. It also comes with code that tests for demographic data as well.

The following link can be used with the program, but you need to divide some images into different folders named "train", "val", and "test".
